[lazy-js-utils](https://github.com/Simon-He95/lazy-js-utils) is an out-of-the-box tool library implemented in pure JavaScript, mainly used to simplify the development process and improve development efficiency. .
::: warning
lazy-js-utils is currently still in `under development` status. Currently 200+ commonly used functions have been compiled, but the documentation and API may still change between some versions.

## Motivation

In development, we are often involved in a lot of repetitive work, and even some unfamiliar ones, we need to use Google to check, and then introduce methods and how to call API documents, which will consume a lot of time and energy.

This library provides a large number of commonly used functions to help us develop quickly, and the calling method is designed to be simpler and more scalable. We can even call some DOM operation APIs directly, and they will be available in the DOM internally. It is automatically called when the time comes, instead of having to do some additional load conditions to determine whether the dom exists, so that we can use it more concisely, because many logical judgments will not appear in your code, and the results of your code will appear Very clear and concise.

On the other hand, we have also saved a lot of google to check the api call introduction of different libraries. This library basically meets your great needs and hopes to bring more convenience to developers.

## Features

Minimalist calls, available out of the box, make your upper-level code more concise and clear, and bring better type hints based on typescript...

## Threshold

It is not a very special wheel, it is just a simple encapsulation implementation of javascript functions. If you are interested in the implementation, you can get answers from the source code. If you have some better ideas, you are welcome to put them forward and we will work on them as soon as possible. To improve this library, you are welcome to join.
